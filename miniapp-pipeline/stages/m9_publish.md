## How to Publish

Publishing is simple: **create a post containing your app URL**.

### Step 1: Open Base App

Launch the Base app on your mobile device.

### Step 2: Compose a Post

Tap the compose button to create a new post (cast).

### Step 3: Add Your URL

Include your mini app URL in the post:
```
https://[your-project].vercel.app
```

The app will automatically render as a rich embed when posted.

### Step 4: Add Context

Write a caption that:
- Explains what your app does
- Gives users a reason to try it
- Includes a call to action

### Step 5: Post It

Tap post. Your mini app is now live!

## Caption Best Practices

### DO

**Lead with value:**
> "Track your daily gratitude and see what your friends are thankful for"

**Be specific:**
> "A simple way to share one thing you're grateful for each day"

**Include a call to action:**
> "Try it and share your first gratitude"

**Keep it short:**
1-2 sentences is ideal. Let the app speak for itself.

### DON'T

**Don't oversell:**
> ~~"The BEST gratitude app EVER!!! 🚀🚀🚀"~~

**Don't be vague:**
> ~~"Check out my new app"~~

**Don't forget the URL:**
Without the URL, there's nothing to launch.
