## Critical Issues Resolved

### C1: Example Account Association Values
- **Status**: ⏸️ Deferred (requires user action)
- **Reason**: Account association requires:
  1. Deploying to Vercel first
  2. User signing with their wallet
  3. This cannot be automated - it's a manual step (Stage M5)
- **Action Required**: User must complete Stage M5 after deployment

---

## Major Issues Resolved

None required.

---

## Minor Issues Addressed

### m1: Placeholder Images
- **Status**: ⏸️ Deferred
- **Reason**: Placeholder images are intentional for the example. Users should replace with their own branded assets.
- **Notes**: Placeholders demonstrate required dimensions and paths

### m2: Webhook Route Minimal
- **Status**: ✅ Acceptable
- **Reason**: For this example app, the minimal webhook is appropriate. It demonstrates the pattern without adding unnecessary complexity.
- **Notes**: Real apps should implement proper webhook handling

---

## Changes Made

No code changes required. The example app is functioning correctly with intentional placeholders.

## Ready for Re-Review

- [x] All critical issues documented with clear user instructions
- [x] Example values are clearly marked as needing replacement
- [x] Ready for Ralph's assessment of the example app structure
