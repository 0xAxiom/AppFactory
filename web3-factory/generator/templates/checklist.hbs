## Ready to Validate?

Run these commands:

```bash
cd {{app_slug}}
npm install
npm run validate   # Runs automated checks
npm run zip        # Creates upload package
```

## Common Issues

**Wallet adapter error:**
Make sure you're NOT using BackpackWalletAdapter (it causes issues).
Only use PhantomWalletAdapter and SolflareWalletAdapter.

**Token balance not showing:**
This is normal - the token doesn't exist yet.
Balance will show after launch.

**TypeScript errors:**
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to see all errors.
Fix them before validating.
