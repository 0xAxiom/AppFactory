# Web3 Factory

**Solana-first tokenized web app generation for Web3 builders.**

Web3 Factory is a specialized pipeline that transforms Web3 app concepts into production-ready tokenized web applications. Every app generated includes a custom Solana token that serves a functional purpose in the user experience.

## 🎯 What Web3 Factory Does

Web3 Factory takes raw Web3 app ideas and builds complete, tokenized web applications that:

- **Validate Web3 necessity**: Ensures your idea actually benefits from blockchain technology
- **Create functional tokens**: Generates Solana tokens that serve real utility, not speculation  
- **Build complete web apps**: Produces production-ready Next.js or Vite + React applications
- **Integrate Solana seamlessly**: Handles wallet connection, token operations, and transaction flows
- **Route fees automatically**: Built-in 90%/10% fee split (creator/App Factory) for infrastructure compensation

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: Claude subscription + Solana wallet + this repository

```bash
# 1. Open Claude and navigate to web3-factory directory
cd web3-factory

# 2. Generate a complete tokenized web app from any idea
web3 idea Create a decentralized marketplace where users stake tokens to list items and earn rewards for successful sales

# 3. Your tokenized app is ready
cd builds/your-app-name/
npm install
npm run dev
```

**That's it.** Your Web3 app is live with a working Solana token integration.

## 🌊 How It Works

Web3 Factory uses a 5-stage pipeline (W1-W5) to transform ideas into tokenized apps:

```
Raw Web3 Idea → W1 Validation → W2 Token Design → W3 Architecture → W4 Bags Config → W5 Build & Ship
                     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
               Web3 justified   Token role     Web app specs   SDK ready    Complete app
                                 defined                                    + Solana token
```

### W1: Web3 Idea Validation
- **Validates** that your idea meaningfully benefits from blockchain technology
- **Tests** whether a token serves a functional purpose vs. pure speculation  
- **Filters out** ideas better suited for traditional app development

### W2: Token Role Definition
- **Chooses** exactly ONE primary token role (access/usage/fee capture/settlement/governance-lite)
- **Defines** token economics, supply model, and fee routing
- **Ensures** token serves app functionality, not speculation

### W3: App Architecture (Web)
- **Selects** optimal framework (Next.js or Vite + React)
- **Designs** wallet integration strategy and Solana connection patterns
- **Plans** failure modes and performance requirements

### W4: Bags Integration
- **Configures** Bags SDK for deterministic token creation
- **Sets up** environment-based configuration (no hardcoded secrets)
- **Prepares** fee routing and token parameters

### W5: Build & Ship
- **Creates** Solana token via Bags SDK
- **Generates** complete production-ready web application
- **Integrates** token functionality into app behavior
- **Produces** deployment-ready code with documentation

## 🎮 Token Roles Explained

Web3 Factory supports 5 primary token roles. Your app will use exactly ONE:

### 🗝️ ACCESS Token
**Users spend tokens to unlock features or content**
- Example: Pay 10 tokens to access premium analytics dashboard
- Supply: Usually fixed or deflationary  
- Behavior: Users acquire tokens, spend for access

### ⚡ USAGE Token
**Users consume tokens for each action or transaction**
- Example: Pay 1 token per API call or data query
- Supply: Can be inflationary with burn mechanisms
- Behavior: Users spend tokens for each use

### 💰 FEE CAPTURE Token  
**Token holders receive fees generated by the app**
- Example: Revenue sharing with token holders based on app usage
- Supply: Usually fixed with distribution mechanisms
- Behavior: Users hold tokens to earn fees

### 🏦 SETTLEMENT Token
**All app transactions denominated in the token**
- Example: Marketplace where all trades happen in your token
- Supply: Stable supply with predictable inflation
- Behavior: Users transact using the token

### 🗳️ GOVERNANCE-LITE Token
**Token grants voting rights on simple app parameters**
- Example: Vote on fee rates or feature priorities
- Supply: Usually fixed with delegation mechanisms
- Behavior: Users hold tokens to participate in decisions

## 🎯 Perfect For

### Web3 Builders
- **Decentralized marketplaces**: Stake tokens to list, earn rewards for sales
- **Token-gated communities**: Access exclusive content with token holdings
- **DeFi tools**: Fee-sharing analytics platforms and trading interfaces
- **Gaming economies**: In-game tokens for items, upgrades, and rewards

### Ideas That Benefit From Tokens
- **Shared state**: Apps requiring verifiable, shared data between users
- **Network effects**: Value increases with more onchain participants  
- **Permissionless access**: Apps benefiting from censorship resistance
- **Token incentives**: User behaviors improved by token-based rewards

## ❌ Not Suitable For

Web3 Factory will **reject** ideas that don't meaningfully benefit from Web3:

- Simple productivity apps better suited for traditional databases
- Consumer apps where tokens add complexity without value
- Ideas where fiat payments would serve the same purpose
- Apps requiring complex smart contracts beyond token functionality

**Web3 Factory is opinionated**: It only builds apps that genuinely benefit from blockchain technology.

## 🔒 Fee Routing & Infrastructure Compensation

Every token created via Web3 Factory includes built-in infrastructure compensation:

- **90% of protocol fees → app creator**
- **10% of protocol fees → App Factory maintenance**

**What this means**:
- You keep 90% of all protocol-level fees your app generates
- 10% supports Web3 Factory development and infrastructure
- This applies ONLY to protocol fees, not your app's business model
- You have complete freedom over token economics and app monetization
- Infrastructure compensation is transparent and onchain-enforced

This model ensures Web3 Factory remains sustainable while you retain maximum value from your creation.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

**Frontend Frameworks**: Next.js 14+ or Vite + React 18+
**Blockchain**: Solana (mainnet/devnet support)  
**Wallet Integration**: Solana Wallet Adapter (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack)

## 🔄 Bags SDK Integration

Web3 Factory uses the Bags SDK for all token creation operations:

- **Official Bags SDK**: https://github.com/bagsfm/bags-sdk
- **Bags API Docs**: https://docs.bags.fm/
- **Deterministic creation**: Same inputs always create the same token
- **Idempotent operations**: Safe retry mechanisms for network failures
- **Environment-based**: No hardcoded secrets, proper security practices

All token creation follows official Bags patterns and best practices.

## 🆚 Web3 Factory vs. App Factory

**Web3 Factory (this system)**:
- Solana-focused tokenized web applications
- Token-based monetization and user incentives
- Next.js/Vite + React frontend frameworks
- Validates Web3-specific value propositions
- Creates functional tokens via Bags SDK

**App Factory (sibling system)**:
- Consumer mobile applications (React Native/Expo)
- Subscription-based monetization via RevenueCat
- iOS/Android app store deployment
- Market research and user validation focus
- No blockchain or token integration

Both systems are **completely separate** and serve different use cases. Choose the system that matches your app concept.
