### Installation

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Run on device/simulator**
   ```bash
   # iOS
   npm run ios
   
   # Android
   npm run android
   
   # Web (for testing)
   npm run web
   ```

### Building for Production

```bash

npm install -g eas-cli

# Configure your project
eas build:configure

# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios

# Build for Android
eas build --platform android
```

## Architecture

### Core Principles
1. **Energy-First**: All functionality adapts to current cognitive capacity
2. **Supportive**: No shame, guilt, or pressure - only gentle guidance
3. **Accessible**: Built for diverse cognitive and motor abilities
4. **Local-First**: Your data stays on your device

### Key Components

#### Energy System
- `EnergyContext`: Manages energy levels and history
- `EnergyIndicator`: Visual energy display component
- `patternAnalysis`: Learns from user patterns

#### Task Management
- `TaskContext`: Handles task state and operations
- `TaskCard`: Flexible task display with energy matching
- `taskRecommendations`: AI-powered task suggestions

#### Focus System
- Adaptive timer lengths based on energy
- Gentle session management
- Break reminders and celebrations
