# Launch Plan Pipeline Addition Report

**Date**: 2026-01-09
**Author**: Claude Code (Opus 4.5)
**Status**: COMPLETE

---

## Summary

Added mandatory `launch_plan.md` generation and verification to the Stage 10 build pipeline.

---

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/generate_launch_plan.sh` | Synthesizes launch_plan.md from stage artifacts |
| `scripts/verify_launch_plan_present.sh` | Verifies launch_plan.md exists with all 8 sections |

---

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `templates/agents/10_app_builder.md` | Added gates 8-9 for launch plan generation/verification; added launch_plan.md to mandatory artifacts table; updated success criteria; updated build output structure |

---

## Launch Plan Content Structure

The generated `launch_plan.md` contains 9 required sections:

1. **App Overview** - Name, value prop, target user, problem (from Stage 02)
2. **MVP Scope (V1)** - Core features + Out of Scope table (from Stage 02, 02.5)
3. **Post-MVP Roadmap** - Feature/version/rationale table (from Stage 02)
4. **MVP Success Criteria** - Measurable success metrics (from Stage 02, 04)
5. **Monetization Summary** - Free limits, pro unlocks, paywall, pricing (from Stage 04)
6. **ASO & Market Positioning** - Categories, keywords, differentiation (from Stage 01, 09)
7. **Technical Constraints** - OS versions, limits, offline support (from Stage 05, 06)
8. **Privacy & Compliance** - Policy URL, developer entity, data practices, third-party processors (from Stage 09.2)
9. **Launch Checklist** - Pre-submission verification checklist (from Stage 07, 10)

## Enforcement Integration

### Gate Ordering

```
Gate 7: aggregate_market_research.sh
Gate 8: generate_launch_plan.sh    <- NEW
Gate 9: verify_launch_plan_present.sh    <- NEW
Gate 10: generate_privacy_policy.sh    <- ADDED (policy page creator)
Gate 11: verify_privacy_policy.sh    <- ADDED (policy page creator)
```

### Failure Behavior

- If launch plan generation fails → build fails
- If launch plan verification fails → build fails
- Missing sections → verification fails
- Empty file → verification fails

---

## Output Location

```
builds/<idea_dir>/<build_id>/launch_plan.md
builds/<idea_dir>/<build_id>/launch_plan_warnings.md  (if fields missing)
```

---

## No Weakening of Existing Enforcement

- All existing gates preserved
- All existing proof artifacts unchanged
- Launch plan added as additional gate, not replacement
- No consolidation of existing checks

---

## Verification

Scripts made executable:
- `chmod +x scripts/generate_launch_plan.sh`
- `chmod +x scripts/verify_launch_plan_present.sh`
