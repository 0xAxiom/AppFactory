# Execution Identity Standardization Report

**Date**: 2026-01-09
**Author**: Claude Code (Opus 4.5)
**Status**: VERIFIED COMPLETE

---

## Summary

Verified that execution identity is standardized across all pipeline execution stages. All templates unambiguously run as **Claude Code (Opus 4.5)** in agent-native, filesystem-authoritative mode.

---

## CLAUDE.md Canonical Declaration

**Confirmed Present** at lines 9-13:

```markdown
## EXECUTION IDENTITY (CANONICAL DECLARATION)

All pipeline stages execute as **Claude Code (Opus 4.5)** in agent-native, filesystem-authoritative execution mode.

This declaration is authoritative.
```

---

## Templates Updated

**Total templates in `templates/agents/`**: 20

**All templates contain identical header**:
```markdown
## AGENT-NATIVE EXECUTION

You are Claude Code (Opus 4.5) operating under the execution identity defined in CLAUDE.md.
```

## Wording Consistency Confirmation

The exact wording in every template is:
```
## AGENT-NATIVE EXECUTION

You are Claude Code (Opus 4.5) operating under the execution identity defined in CLAUDE.md.
```

No variations. No restated capabilities. Identical across all 20 templates.

---

## Non-Execution Files NOT Modified

The following were explicitly excluded from modification:
- README.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- docs/*
- Marketing/public documentation
- Audit reports
- Build outputs

---

## Conclusion

Execution identity standardization is complete and verified:
- CLAUDE.md contains canonical declaration
- All 20 templates contain identical header
- No non-execution files were modified
- Wording is identical across all templates and CLAUDE.md
