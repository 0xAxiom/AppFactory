# Execution Identity Standardization Report

**Date**: 2026-01-09
**Task Type**: Pipeline consistency fix (CONTROL PLANE LEVEL)
**Status**: COMPLETE

## Objective

Standardize the execution identity across all pipeline execution stages to ensure consistent, authoritative identity declaration throughout the App Factory pipeline.

## Changes Made

### 1. CLAUDE.md - Canonical Declaration Added

Location: `CLAUDE.md` (root control plane document)

Added new section **EXECUTION IDENTITY (CANONICAL DECLARATION)**:

```markdown
## EXECUTION IDENTITY (CANONICAL DECLARATION)

All pipeline stages execute as **Claude Code (Opus 4.5)** in agent-native, filesystem-authoritative execution mode.

This declaration is authoritative. All pipeline stage templates reference this section for identity consistency.

### Identity Properties
- **Model**: Claude Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)
- **Mode**: Agent-native execution
- **Authority**: Filesystem-authoritative (artifacts on disk are source of truth)
- **Execution Context**: Claude Code CLI environment

### Binding Rule
Every stage template MUST include the standard header referencing this identity declaration. Non-compliant templates are invalid.
```

### 2. Template Updates - Standard Header Applied

All 16 templates in `templates/agents/` updated with standardized header:

```markdown
## AGENT-NATIVE EXECUTION

You are Claude Code (Opus 4.5) operating under the execution identity defined in CLAUDE.md.
```

#### Templates Updated:

| File | Stage | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| `01_dream.md` | Dream Stage 01 | UPDATED |
| `01_market_research.md` | Stage 01 | UPDATED |
| `02_product_spec.md` | Stage 02 | UPDATED |
| `02.5_product_reality.md` | Stage 02.5 | UPDATED |
| `02.7_dependency_resolution.md` | Stage 02.7 | UPDATED |
| `03_ux.md` | Stage 03 | UPDATED |
| `04_monetization.md` | Stage 04 | UPDATED |
| `05_architecture.md` | Stage 05 | UPDATED |
| `06_builder_handoff.md` | Stage 06 | UPDATED |
| `07_polish.md` | Stage 07 | UPDATED |
| `08_brand.md` | Stage 08 | UPDATED |
| `09_release_planning.md` | Stage 09 | UPDATED |
| `09.5_runtime_sanity_harness.md` | Stage 09.5 | UPDATED |
| `09.7_build_contract_synthesis.md` | Stage 09.7 | UPDATED |
| `10.1_design_authenticity_check.md` | Stage 10.1 | UPDATED |
| `10_app_builder.md` | Stage 10 | UPDATED |

**Total**: 16/16 templates updated

## Verification

### Standard Header Format
Each template now contains:
1. `## AGENT-NATIVE EXECUTION` section heading
2. Blank line
3. `You are Claude Code (Opus 4.5) operating under the execution identity defined in CLAUDE.md.`
4. Blank line
5. Stage-specific purpose description

### Consistency Check
- All templates reference CLAUDE.md for identity authority
- All templates use identical identity declaration text
- Stage-specific context preserved after the standard header

## Impact

This change ensures:
1. **Identity Consistency**: All stages declare the same execution identity
2. **Authority Centralization**: CLAUDE.md is the single source of truth for identity
3. **Pipeline Coherence**: Agents operating at any stage share the same identity context
4. **Maintainability**: Future identity updates only require CLAUDE.md modification

## Non-Breaking Change Verification

This is a documentation/declaration change only:
- No behavioral changes to pipeline execution
- No schema changes
- No artifact format changes
- Existing runs remain valid
