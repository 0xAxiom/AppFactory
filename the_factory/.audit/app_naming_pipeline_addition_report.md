## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `templates/agents/09.1_app_naming.md` | Stage template for app naming and availability research |
| `scripts/generate_app_naming.sh` | Generates naming.md from stage09.1.json |
| `scripts/verify_app_naming.sh` | Validates naming artifacts meet requirements |

---

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `templates/agents/10_app_builder.md` | Added gates 10-11 for app naming generation/verification; added naming.md to mandatory artifacts; updated Definition of Done table; updated success criteria |
| `scripts/generate_launch_plan.sh` | Enhanced Section 6 (ASO) to include naming research data, alternates, collision notes |

## Stage 09.1: App Naming & Availability Research

### Purpose
Generate distinctive app names with verified availability through web research to reduce collision risk on Apple App Store and Google Play.

### Constraints Enforced
- **App name**: Maximum 30 characters (Apple App Store & Google Play)
- **Subtitle**: Maximum 30 characters (iOS)
- **Alternates**: Minimum 8 viable alternatives required
- **Web research**: Minimum 4 searches per top candidate (mandatory)

### JSON Artifact Schema
```json
{
  "naming": {
    "recommended_name": "string (max 30 chars)",
    "recommended_subtitle": "string (max 30 chars)",
    "character_count": "number",
    "alternates": [/* 8+ alternatives */],
    "rationale": "string",
    "naming_rules_applied": ["string"]
  },
  "availability_research": {
    "search_queries_executed": [/* web search evidence */],
    "collision_findings": ["string"],
    "collision_risk_level": "low|medium|high",
    "recommendation_confidence": "high|medium|low"
  },
  "store_metadata": {
    "final_policy_slug": "string (kebab-case)",
    "bundle_id_slug": "string",
    "store_search_terms": ["string"]
  }
}
```

---

## Web Research Requirement (Mandatory)

### Required Searches Per Candidate
For top 5 candidate names:
1. `"<name> app iOS"`
2. `"<name> app Android"`
3. `"site:apps.apple.com <name>"`
4. `"site:play.google.com <name>"`

### Rejection Criteria
Names MUST be rejected if:
- Exact match exists in App Store or Play Store
- Name is trademarked by major company
- Name is generic single word
- Name is confusingly similar to top-100 app

---

## Build Output

### naming.md Structure
```markdown
# App Naming Report
## Final Chosen Name
- App Name, Subtitle, Character Count
- Collision Risk, Confidence

## Alternate Names (8+ Required)
| # | Name | Subtitle | Rationale |

## Collision Research Summary
- Search queries executed
- Collision findings

## Manual Reservation Required
> Confirm name in App Store Connect / Play Console before submission.
```

---

## Enforcement Integration

### Gate Ordering (Stage 10)

```
Gate 8:  generate_launch_plan.sh
Gate 9:  verify_launch_plan_present.sh
Gate 10: generate_app_naming.sh      <- NEW
Gate 11: verify_app_naming.sh        <- NEW
Gate 12: generate_privacy_policy.sh
Gate 13: verify_privacy_policy.sh
Gate 14: verify_assets_are_png.sh
```

### Failure Conditions

Stage 10 MUST fail if:
- No recommended name produced
- Name exceeds 30 characters
- Fewer than 8 alternates provided
- No evidence of web research queries

---

## Launch Plan Integration

Section 6 (ASO & Market Positioning) now includes:
- Final app name from naming research
- Subtitle from naming research
- Collision risk level
- Policy slug
- Top 3 alternate names
- Collision notes
- Manual verification reminder

---

## Important Notes

- Web research is MANDATORY, not optional
- This research reduces collision risk but does NOT guarantee availability
- Manual reservation in App Store Connect / Play Console still required
- Stage 09.1 does NOT claim "100% reserved" unless verified in console
