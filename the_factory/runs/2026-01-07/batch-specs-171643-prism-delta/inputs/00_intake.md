- **Run ID**: batch-specs-171643-prism-delta
- **Seed Phrase**: batch-specs-171643-prism-delta
- **Exploration Vectors**: ["personal admin simplification", "creative momentum tracking", "accessibility-friendly design", "travel friction reduction", "mindful consumption tools"]
- **Generated**: 2026-01-08T17:16:43Z

## Domain Lens Selection (MANDATORY)
This run will explore 5 distinct consumer-life domains to prevent convergence on productivity/attention clusters:

5. **Mindful Consumption** - Tools for intentional purchasing and resource usage

## Discovery Modes (MANDATORY)
Stage 01 MUST consider 3 discovery modes each run:

1. **Practical Utility** (default consumer apps, problem-solving)
2. **Playful / Meme / Novelty** (delight, humor, shareability, "dumb but sticky")

## Requirements
- EXACTLY 10 ideas with unique IDs
- All ideas subscription-viable

- Complain briefly
- Ask simple questions  
- Express frustration without theory
- Do NOT propose AI solutions themselves
