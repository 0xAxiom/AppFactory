**Status**: Completed  

## Exploration Strategy

**Seed**: batch-specs-160132-meadow-spark  
**Domain Lenses**: Food & Cooking, Creativity & Self-Expression, Travel & Commuting, Elder-Friendly Tech, Personal Automation

This run successfully applied domain lens diversification to prevent convergence on productivity/attention clusters. Research spanned 5 distinct consumer-life domains with evidence-backed validation.

## Market Trends Identified

### 1. Meal Planning Simplification (High Opportunity)
Users frustrated with complex recipe apps requiring too many steps and complicated planning processes. Evidence shows users become "weary of fancy meals" due to coordination complexity.
