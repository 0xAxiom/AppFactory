# EVP Analyzer - Core Loop

## The Investigation Cycle

EVP Analyzer's engagement is built around the **Investigation Cycle**—a 5-stage loop that drives both single-session satisfaction and long-term retention.

## Stage Details

### 1. CAPTURE
**User Action**: Start investigation recording
**Motivation**: Curiosity about location, desire to document
**System Response**: Live waveform visualization, recording indicator
**Emotional Payoff**: Anticipation, focus, seriousness

The capture stage establishes the investigative mindset. The serious UI and live waveform immediately differentiate this from toy apps.

### 2. DISCOVER
**User Action**: Notice anomalies (automatic markers or visual cues)
**Motivation**: Finding something interesting
**System Response**: Anomaly markers appear on timeline
**Emotional Payoff**: Excitement, validation, curiosity

This is the "hook" moment. Automatic detection creates "finds" even for beginners. Premium users get more sophisticated detection.

### 3. ANALYZE
**User Action**: Review waveform/spectrogram, replay isolated clips
**Motivation**: Understanding what was captured
**System Response**: Visual analysis tools, loop playback, zoom
**Emotional Payoff**: Insight, investigation satisfaction

Analysis is where users feel like professional investigators. Spectrogram (premium) adds scientific credibility.

### 4. DOCUMENT
**User Action**: Tag clips, add notes, categorize findings
**Motivation**: Building evidence, creating records
**System Response**: Tags saved, session updated
**Emotional Payoff**: Accomplishment, ownership, credibility

Documentation creates investment. Tagged clips become the user's personal evidence collection.

### 5. ACCUMULATE
**User Action**: View growing investigation log
**Motivation**: Seeing progress, building investigation portfolio
**System Response**: Session added to log, session count visible
**Emotional Payoff**: Pride, mastery, sunk cost

The accumulating log drives retention. Users don't want to abandon their investigation history.

## Retention Drivers

| Driver | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Investment Effect** | Growing investigation log creates switching cost |
| **Location Uniqueness** | Every place is a new investigation opportunity |
| **Evidence Collection** | Tagged clips become personal portfolio |
| **Capability Unlock** | Premium enables deeper analysis (spectrogram, advanced detection) |
| **Hobby Identity** | App becomes part of investigator identity |

---

## Loop Frequency

**Expected Cadence**: 1-3 investigations per week for active users
**Session Duration**: 5-30 minutes (recording) + 5-15 minutes (analysis)
**Key Retention Point**: Day 7 (after 2-3 investigations)
