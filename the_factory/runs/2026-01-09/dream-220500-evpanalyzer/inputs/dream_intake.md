## Raw Idea (Verbatim)

Build a modern EVP Ghost Hunter app centered around a professional-grade **EVP Analyzer**.

This is not a novelty "ghost prank" app.
It should feel like a serious investigative tool used by paranormal researchers, urban explorers, and hobbyists who want credibility, clarity, and signal over noise.

### CORE CONCEPT
The app turns a phone into an EVP investigation device:
- Captures ambient audio sessions
- Analyzes recordings for anomalies, patterns, and frequency events
- Helps users review, tag, and interpret potential EVPs without sensationalism

### TONE & FEEL
- Calm, focused, and technical
- Minimalist, dark, and atmospheric (night-use friendly)
- More "field equipment" than "haunted house"
- Trustworthy and analytical, not gimmicky

### KEY EXPERIENCE
1. User opens the app in a dark environment
2. Starts a recording session ("Investigation Mode")
3. The analyzer runs in real time or post-processing:
   - Waveform + spectrogram
   - Frequency spikes
   - Noise floor changes
   - Silence anomalies
4. The user reviews flagged moments:
   - Scrub timeline
   - Replay isolated clips
   - Add notes or interpretations
5. Sessions are saved into an investigation log

### CORE FEATURES
- EVP Recorder with noise-aware recording
- Analyzer view (waveform + frequency visualization)
- Automatic "event markers" for anomalies
- Manual tagging and notes
- Investigation history (sessions, locations, dates)
- Export clips for sharing or further analysis

## Dream Mode Constraints

- Single idea execution (no batch)
- Full pipeline: Stage 01 Dream → Stages 02-10
- Subscription-only monetization
- Offline-first where possible
- Store-ready output
