# Stage 09.1: App Naming & Availability Research

## AGENT-NATIVE EXECUTION

You are Claude Code (Opus 4.5) operating under the execution identity defined in CLAUDE.md.

Generate a high-quality, distinctive app name and verify availability through web research to reduce collision risk on Apple App Store and Google Play.

## MANDATORY NAMING CONSTRAINTS

### Apple App Store Requirements
- App name is limited to **30 characters maximum**
- Name must be **distinctive** (avoid generic or too similar to existing apps)
- Subtitle limited to **30 characters maximum**
- Names that are too similar to existing apps may be rejected

### Google Play Requirements
- Title limited to **30 characters maximum**
- Title should be **unique** and not misleading
- Package name must be globally unique (com.appfactory.<slug>)
- Generic names increase rejection risk

### Quality Guidelines
- Name should be memorable and brandable
- Name should hint at app functionality
- Avoid special characters, numbers (unless essential to brand)
- Consider international trademark implications
- Name should work well spoken aloud (podcast/word-of-mouth)

## INPUTS

## OUTPUTS

Write to idea pack directory:
- `runs/.../ideas/<idea_dir>/stages/stage09.1.json` - Naming data artifact
- `runs/.../ideas/<idea_dir>/outputs/stage09.1_execution.md` - Execution log with research evidence

## EXECUTION STEPS

### Phase 1: Context Gathering

1. **Read Product Specification (Stage 02)**:
   - Extract app name (working title)
   - Extract value proposition
   - Extract core features
   - Extract target user

2. **Read Brand Identity (Stage 08)** if available:
   - Extract brand personality keywords
   - Extract visual identity notes
   - Extract tone of voice

3. **Read Release Planning (Stage 09)** if available:
   - Extract category
   - Extract keywords
   - Extract competitive positioning

### Phase 2: Name Generation

4. **Generate Candidate Names**:
   Generate at least 12 candidate names following these patterns:

   **Pattern Types**:
   - Descriptive: Directly describes function (e.g., "Voice Recorder Pro")
   - Suggestive: Hints at benefit (e.g., "ClearSpeak")
   - Abstract: Invented/coined word (e.g., "Voxly")
   - Compound: Two words combined (e.g., "SoundScape")
   - Acronym/Initialism: If appropriate (e.g., "EVP Lab")

   **For each candidate**:
   - Verify <= 30 characters
   - Generate matching subtitle (<= 30 chars)
   - Note pattern type used

### Phase 3: Web Research (MANDATORY)

5. **Execute Collision Searches**:
   For TOP 5 candidate names, perform ALL of these searches:

   ```
   Search 1: "<name> app iOS"
   Search 2: "<name> app Android"
   Search 3: "site:apps.apple.com <name>"
   Search 4: "site:play.google.com <name>"
   ```

6. **Analyze Search Results**:
   For each search, document:
   - Whether exact name match exists
   - Whether similar/confusing names exist
   - Whether name is associated with major apps
   - Risk level (low/medium/high)

7. **Reject High-Risk Names**:
   REJECT any name that:
   - Exactly matches an existing app
   - Is too similar to a well-known app
   - Is overly generic (e.g., "Notes", "Camera", "Timer")
   - Has trademark concerns

### Phase 4: Final Selection

8. **Select Recommended Name**:
   Choose the name with:
   - Lowest collision risk
   - Best brand fit
   - Strongest memorability
   - Clear app identity

9. **Select 8+ Alternates**:
   From remaining candidates, select at least 8 viable alternatives
   in order of preference.

10. **Generate Slugs**:
    - `final_policy_slug`: kebab-case (e.g., "evp-analyzer-pro")
    - `bundle_id_slug`: normalized for bundle ID (e.g., "evp.analyzer.pro")

### Phase 5: Write Artifacts

11. **Write stage09.1.json**:
    Complete JSON artifact with all naming data and research evidence.

12. **Write Execution Log**:
    Document in `stage09.1_execution.md`:
    - All search queries executed
    - Search results summaries
    - Decision rationale
    - Risk assessment

## COLLISION RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Minimum Search Evidence
- At least 4 searches per top candidate (20+ total searches)
- Search results must be summarized in artifact
- High-risk collisions must be documented

### Rejection Criteria
Names MUST be rejected if:
- Exact match exists in App Store or Play Store
- Name is trademarked by major company
- Name is generic single word (e.g., "Notes", "Weather")
- Name is confusingly similar to top-100 app

### Evidence Requirements
The execution log MUST contain:
- List of all search queries
- Summary of findings per query
- Collision analysis
- Final recommendation justification

## FAILURE CONDITIONS

Stage 09.1 MUST fail if:
- No recommended name is produced
- Recommended name exceeds 30 characters
- Subtitle exceeds 30 characters
- Fewer than 8 alternates provided
- No evidence of web research queries
- Collision research not documented
- High collision risk not disclosed

## STAGE DEPENDENCIES

- **Requires**: Stage 02 (product spec) at minimum
- **Optional inputs**: Stage 08 (brand), Stage 09 (release planning)
- **Enables**: Stage 09.2 (policy pages), Stage 10 (build)

## NAMING TEMPLATES

### For Utility Apps
- "[Verb][Noun]" - RecordVoice, TrackHabits
- "[Noun] [Qualifier]" - Voice Recorder Pro, Habit Tracker Plus
- "[Adjective][Noun]" - QuickNotes, SmartTimer

### For Creative Apps
- Abstract coinages - Canva, Figma, Notion
- Suggestive names - Lightroom, Procreate
- Metaphorical - Evernote, Dropbox

### For Paranormal/Niche Apps
- Domain + Tool - EVP Analyzer, Ghost Detector
- Atmospheric - SpiritBox, PhantomWave
- Scientific - SpectraVoice, FrequencyLab

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- Web research is MANDATORY, not optional
- All character counts must be verified
- Collision findings must be documented even if "none found"
- Manual reservation in App Store Connect / Play Console is still required
- This stage does NOT guarantee availability—only reduces collision risk
