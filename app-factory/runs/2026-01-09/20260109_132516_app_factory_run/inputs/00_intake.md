### Evidence-First Methodology (MANDATORY)

Stage 01 will derive exploration vectors from evidence sweep and emergent clustering.

No pre-selected vectors in intake. Derived vectors will be recorded in:
- stage01_research.md (with signal card clusters)
- stage01.json exploration_config.vectors array

Evidence sweep order and clustering decisions controlled by seed phrase for deterministic reproducibility.

## Market Research Instructions
