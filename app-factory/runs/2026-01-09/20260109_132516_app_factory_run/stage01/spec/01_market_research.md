# Stage 01: Market Research Specification

**Run ID**: 20260109_132516_app_factory_run  
**Generated**: 2026-01-09T13:25:16Z  
**Status**: COMPLETED  

## Executive Summary

Stage 01 successfully generated 10 validated app ideas using evidence-first IdeaMiner methodology. Research focused on identifying user workflow pain points through direct evidence mining from app reviews, user forums, and professional observations.

## Market Research Findings

### Key Trends Identified

**Adaptive Learning Progression**
- **Insight**: Users abandon apps when progression moves too fast for individual skill level
- **Evidence**: Fitness trainers report "on-demand sessions tend to be too fast for beginners"; meditation apps split focus with guidance complexity
- **Opportunity**: High - affects fitness, meditation, and educational app categories

**Feature Minimalism Movement** 
- **Insight**: Users prefer simple, focused tools over complex feature-rich applications
- **Evidence**: Users report being "tired of maintaining productivity tools rather than using them"; "spent more time configuring than building habits"
- **Opportunity**: High - spans productivity, organization, and wellness tools

**Value-Before-Payment Models**
- **Insight**: Subscription apps fail when core value is hidden behind paywall
- **Evidence**: 42.4% of users cite cost concerns; "content behind paywall prevents habit formation before subscribing"
- **Opportunity**: Medium - affects subscription-based wellness and productivity apps

### Competition Landscape

**Oversaturated Markets**:
- Complex productivity suites with extensive feature sets
- Feature-heavy habit trackers with complex configuration
- Guided meditation apps with large audio libraries

**Underexplored Opportunities**:
- Adaptive progression systems that adjust to user pace
- Minimal-interface wellness tools focused on single functions
- Skill-building apps with personal pace adjustment
