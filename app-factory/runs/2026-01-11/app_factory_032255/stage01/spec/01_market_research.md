### 3. Caregiver Technology Gap
- **Opportunity Level**: High
- **Evidence**: PMC research shows medication apps have "difficulty in navigation, poor visibility, lack of transparency" for elderly users.
- **Implication**: Accessibility-focused design for caregiver-oriented apps.

### 4. Document-Centric Home Management
- **Opportunity Level**: High
