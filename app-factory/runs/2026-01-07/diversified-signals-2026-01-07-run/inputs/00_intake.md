## Market Research Instructions
Stage 01 must follow the Market Signal Discovery Playbook above, using the seed and vectors to diversify search patterns while maintaining evidence-based rigor.

## Requirements

### Core Requirements (STABLE)

**INTAKE IMMUTABILITY**: Once written, this intake is READ-ONLY. Claude MUST NOT reinterpret, optimize, or alter constraints mid-run.

Target Market: Mobile app consumers (iOS + Android)
Business Model: Subscription-based (no ads, no one-time purchases)
Platforms: iOS and Android simultaneously
Competition Level: Low to Medium preferred
MVP Scope: Single focused development stage
Framework: React Native with Expo (latest stable)
Monetization: RevenueCat subscription integration mandatory
Auth Strategy: Guest-first, optional accounts

### Standards Compliance

All generated ideas must comply with standards/mobile_app_best_practices_2026.md:

Excluded Categories (Pipeline-blocking):
- Dating apps
- Gambling or betting
- Crypto/Trading apps
- Medical diagnosis or health advice
- Regulated financial services
- Content that requires 18+ age verification

Required Business Model:
- Subscription-only monetization
- RevenueCat integration mandatory
- Store submission ready (Apple App Store + Google Play)
- Guest-first authentication with optional progressive registration

### Market Signal Discovery Playbook

Stage 01 MUST follow this research methodology:

Query Patterns (Rotate and Randomize)

Use these search patterns across different platforms:
- "is there an app for [domain]"
- "looking for an app that [capability]"
- "does anyone know an app [use case]"
- "alternative to [competitor] that [improvement]"
- "I wish there was an app that [missing feature]"
- "why does every [category] app [common complaint]"
- "how do people manage [workflow] without [frustration]"
- "any app for [specific persona] that [specific need]"

### MARKET SIGNAL DIVERSIFICATION FIX

You MUST correct Stage 01 market research bias caused by over-reliance on Reddit-style discourse.

**SOURCE WEIGHTING CORRECTION**

Reddit (e.g. r/productivity, r/ADHD, r/getmotivated) MUST NO LONGER be treated as the dominant or default signal source.

Reddit signals are:
- Qualitative
- Verbose
- Over-indexed on meta-thinking and AI framing

They are VALID but must be WEIGHTED LOWER than low-friction complaint sources.

**PROMOTED PRIMARY SOURCES (MANDATORY)**

Stage 01 MUST prioritize signals from sources where users:
- Complain briefly
- Ask simple questions
- Express frustration without theory
- Do NOT propose AI solutions themselves

Examples (non-exhaustive):
- App Store / Google Play 1–2★ reviews
- App Store Q&A sections
- YouTube comments on "how I do X" or "why X sucks"
- Chrome Extension Store reviews
- Gumroad / Etsy reviews for planners, templates, trackers
- Twitter replies and quote tweets (NOT long threads)
- Forum comments (not posts) in niche communities
- Comments on "alternatives to X" blog posts

**REDDIT USAGE RULE**

Reddit may be used ONLY to:
- Confirm a problem seen elsewhere
- Extract short, concrete complaints
- Validate demand magnitude

Reddit MUST NOT:
- Define the core framing of the problem
- Introduce AI-first language by default
- Be the sole source for an idea

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENT**

For each generated idea, Stage 01 MUST ensure:
- At least one primary signal comes from a NON-REDDIT source
- Evidence summary emphasizes repeated, low-friction complaints
- Problem framing remains solvable with simple, client-side logic unless explicitly justified otherwise

This is a WEIGHTING and SOURCE DIVERSIFICATION rule, not a schema change.

## Quality Gates
- EXACTLY 10 ideas with unique IDs
- All ideas subscription-viable
- Evidence-backed with direct quotes
- Standards-compliant (no excluded categories)
- Validation scores based on: Signal Strength (40%) + Competition Gap (30%) + Subscription Fit (20%) + MVP Feasibility (10%)
