# Stage 01: Market Research Specification

**Run**: batch-specs-010721-3472  
**Date**: 2026-01-08T05:21:07Z  
**Status**: Completed

## Exploration Strategy

**Seed**: batch-specs-010721-3472-tide-rhythm  
**Domain Lenses**: Lightweight utilities, personal organization, social coordination, learning practice, wellness habits

This run successfully applied domain lens diversification focusing on user preferences for simplicity versus complexity across diverse consumer-life domains.

## Market Trends Identified

### 1. Single-Purpose Utility Demand (High Opportunity)
Strong user preference for tools that "do one thing well" rather than multi-feature applications. GitHub extension repositories show consistent requests for "simple, single-purpose utilities" that solve specific problems without complexity. Users actively seek alternatives to bloated multi-tool applications.

### 2. Organization App Complexity Rejection (High Opportunity)  
Users overwhelmed by feature-rich organization platforms like Notion. Direct feedback shows users get "overwhelmed or distracted by the features" and prefer "super bare bones" apps that don't require learning complex database systems. Clear demand for simplified personal data management.

### 3. Family Coordination Simplification Need (Medium Opportunity)
Popular family apps like Cozi and TimeTree have usability issues despite market dominance. Users report wanting solutions that "reduce the mental load of coordinating family life" without comprehensive calendar complexity. Gap exists for ultra-simple coordination tools.

### 4. Learning Tool Setup Frustration (High Opportunity)
Educational apps criticized for requiring extensive setup before usage. Users complain about spending "more time learning the app than your actual subject" and want tools that "just open and start learning." Strong preference for instant-start educational tools.

### 5. Minimal Habit Tracking Preference (Medium Opportunity)
Habit tracking apps like Streaks succeed by "limiting to 12 habits intentionally—to prevent overwhelming yourself." Users prefer apps that are "simple enough for quick daily check-ins" over comprehensive wellness platforms with detailed analytics and complex tracking.
