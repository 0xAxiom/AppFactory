# Stage 01: Market Research Specification

**Run**: batch-specs-010718-5233  
**Date**: 2026-01-08T02:07:18Z  
**Status**: Completed

## Exploration Strategy

**Seed**: batch-specs-010718-5233-crystal-drift  
**Domain Lenses**: Home logistics, creative workflows, accessibility design, travel preparation, digital wellness

This run successfully applied domain lens diversification to prevent convergence on productivity/attention clusters. Research spanned 5 distinct consumer-life domains with evidence-backed validation.

## Market Trends Identified

### 1. Home Logistics Simplification Demand (Medium Opportunity)
Users increasingly frustrated with complex home organizing apps. Evidence shows preference for "straightforward" solutions without overwhelming features. Tody app praised specifically for being "not too complicated" - indicating strong market demand for simplified home task management.

### 2. Creative Consistency Without Complexity (High Opportunity)  
Artists explicitly reject project management overhead for simple creative tracking. Direct quote evidence: "adding a project management app to your workflow isn't meant to overwhelm you, stress you out, or confuse you." Clear gap for minimal creative momentum tools.

### 3. Accessibility App Usability Crisis (High Opportunity)
Accessibility tools ironically creating barriers for disabled users. TalkBack user testimony: "awful to navigate" and "can be a bigger barrier just trying to use the app." Critical need for accessible-first design with actual user testing.

### 4. Travel App Feature Overload (Medium Opportunity)
Packing and travel apps suffering from feature bloat. Users report "extensive features can make the interface feel cluttered and overwhelming, especially for new users." Clear preference for simple, focused travel helpers.

### 5. Digital Wellness Through Simplification (High Opportunity)
Growing movement toward minimal phone experiences. Apps that "turn your phone into a light phone alternative" gaining popularity as users seek intentional friction over complex analytics.

## Competition Analysis

**Oversaturated Markets**:
- Complex cleaning schedulers with multi-room tracking systems
- Feature-heavy creative project management platforms  
- Comprehensive accessibility suites with steep learning curves
- Travel planning platforms with endless configuration options
- Screen time trackers with detailed behavioral analytics

**Underexplored Opportunities**:
- Single-purpose home logistics helpers with minimal setup
- Creative consistency tracking without administrative overhead
- Dead-simple accessibility tools designed by disabled users
- Focused travel preparation helpers for specific needs
- Intentionally boring digital wellness interventions
