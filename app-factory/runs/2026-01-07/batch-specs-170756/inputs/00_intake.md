### MARKET SIGNAL DIVERSIFICATION FIX

**SOURCE WEIGHTING CORRECTION**:
Reddit (e.g. r/productivity, r/ADHD, r/getmotivated) MUST NO LONGER be treated as the dominant or default signal source. Reddit signals are qualitative, verbose, and over-indexed on meta-thinking and AI framing. They are VALID but must be WEIGHTED LOWER than low-friction complaint sources.

**PROMOTED PRIMARY SOURCES (MANDATORY)**:
Stage 01 MUST prioritize signals from sources where users complain briefly, ask simple questions, express frustration without theory, and do NOT propose AI solutions themselves:
- App Store / Google Play 1–2★ reviews
- App Store Q&A sections
- YouTube comments on "how I do X" or "why X sucks"
- Chrome Extension Store reviews
- Gumroad / Etsy reviews for planners, templates, trackers
- Twitter replies and quote tweets (NOT long threads)
- Forum comments (not posts) in niche communities
- Comments on "alternatives to X" blog posts

**REDDIT USAGE RULE**:
Reddit may be used ONLY to confirm a problem seen elsewhere, extract short concrete complaints, and validate demand magnitude. Reddit MUST NOT define the core framing of the problem, introduce AI-first language by default, or be the sole source for an idea.

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENT**:
For each generated idea, Stage 01 MUST ensure at least one primary signal comes from a NON-REDDIT source, evidence summary emphasizes repeated low-friction complaints, and problem framing remains solvable with simple client-side logic unless explicitly justified otherwise.
