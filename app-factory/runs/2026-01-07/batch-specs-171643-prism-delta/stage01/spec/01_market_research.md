# Stage 01: Market Research Specification

**Run**: batch-specs-171643-prism-delta  
**Date**: 2026-01-08  
**Status**: Completed

## Exploration Strategy

**Seed**: batch-specs-171643-prism-delta  
**Domain Lenses**: Personal Admin, Creative Workflows, Accessibility Design, Travel Logistics, Mindful Consumption

This run successfully applied domain lens diversification to prevent convergence on productivity/attention clusters. Research spanned 5 distinct consumer-life domains with evidence-backed validation.

## Market Trends Identified

### 1. Personal Admin Complexity Fatigue (High Opportunity)
Users overwhelmed by document management apps requiring complex setup. Document management software market growing from $8.32B in 2025 to $24.34B by 2032, but users seek simplification over features.

### 2. Creative Momentum Without Complexity (Medium Opportunity)  
Artists need momentum tracking tools that 'sustain creative project momentum' while 'eliminating repetitive manual tasks' but existing solutions have 'complex processes' and 'approval bottlenecks'.

### 3. Accessibility Design Paradox (High Opportunity)
Accessibility apps become 'frustrating barriers' because 'solutions that try to address everything work well for no one'. Need accessible-first design with real disabled user testing.

### 4. Travel Logistics Overwhelm (Medium Opportunity)
Multi-modal travel planning creates 'overwhelming' experiences with 'myriad options' causing 'daunting task' for users seeking 'simple alternatives'.

### 5. Mindful Consumption Growth (Medium Opportunity)
Users battle 'online shopping addiction' and 'impulse buys'. Apps show users 'saved $200 a month when making mindful purchasing decisions'.
