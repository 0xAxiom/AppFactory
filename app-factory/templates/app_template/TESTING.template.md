## Automated Tests (Future)

This project uses manual smoke tests. For automated testing, consider adding:

- **Jest** for unit tests
- **Detox** for E2E tests
- **React Native Testing Library** for component tests

These are not required for Factory Ready standard but recommended for production apps.
