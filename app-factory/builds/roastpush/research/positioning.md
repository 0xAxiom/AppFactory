# Positioning Strategy: RoastPush

## Brand Positioning Statement

**For** self-aware adults who appreciate dark humor and want unexpected laughs throughout their day,

**RoastPush is** an entertainment app

**That** delivers random insults via push notifications at unpredictable times.

**Unlike** traditional insult apps that require you to open them,

**RoastPush** brings the roasts to you automatically, creating surprise moments of humor without any effort.

## Unique Value Proposition

### Primary UVP
**"The only app that roasts you automatically."**

This single sentence captures the core differentiation: automatic delivery. Every competitor requires active engagement. RoastPush is passive entertainment.

### Supporting Value Props
1. **Surprise-driven**: You never know when the next roast hits
2. **Customizable**: Control intensity from mild to savage
3. **Effortless**: Set it and forget it
4. **Private**: No data leaves your device
5. **Premium**: Subscription-worthy quality and content

## Target Positioning

### Market Position: Premium Niche Entertainment

RoastPush positions as a premium product in a niche category. Rather than competing on price with ad-supported alternatives, we compete on experience quality and unique functionality.
