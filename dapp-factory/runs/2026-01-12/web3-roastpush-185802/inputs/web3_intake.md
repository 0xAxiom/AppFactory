## Raw Idea

Build a real-time multiplayer roast battle app. Users compete in fast voice-first roast rounds (1v1 or groups). Each round has an AI-generated roast prompt. Players deliver roasts, the audience reacts live with emojis, and AI judges based on savagery, creativity, delivery, and relevance. Core Features: 1v1, group (3–8), themed roast rooms 15–45s timed rounds, voice + text AI scoring + funny commentary Live emoji reactions that influence scores Instant vertical clip generation (15–60s) One-tap sharing to TikTok/Reels/X Daily & weekly leaderboards Friend invites + quick anonymous play AI moderation for hate/doxxing SOL Rewards (Skill-Based): Winners earn SOL from leaderboard and challenge reward pools Optional small SOL entry for ranked rooms SOL used for premium arenas, themes, cosmetics, and tipping No luck or gambling mechanics — performance only UI & Vibe: High-energy neon/flame theme, crowd sound effects, dark mode, push notifications for challenges and viral clips. Goal: Create a viral roast game that turns savage humor into shareable clips, social clout, and SOL rewards with fast matchmaking and brutal AI judging.
