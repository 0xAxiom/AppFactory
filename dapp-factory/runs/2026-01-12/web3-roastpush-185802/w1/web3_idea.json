    "idea_id": "roastpush-185802",
    "idea_name": "RoastPush",
    "original_concept": "Real-time multiplayer roast battle app with voice-first rounds, AI judging, live emoji reactions, clip generation, and SOL-based skill rewards. Features 1v1 and group battles (3-8 players), themed rooms, timed rounds (15-45s), instant vertical clip generation, social sharing, daily/weekly leaderboards, and AI moderation.",
    "target_users": "Gen-Z and millennial content creators, competitive gamers, comedy enthusiasts, and streamers looking to monetize their wit and roasting skills in a high-energy social gaming environment.",
    "core_problem": "Current social entertainment lacks a structured competitive outlet for humor that rewards genuine skill. Comedy creators struggle to monetize wit outside of traditional content platforms. No gamified system exists that turns roasting ability into verifiable earnings with instant viral clip generation.",
    "web3_justification": "Onchain settlement enables trustless prize distribution, verifiable leaderboards, and global permissionless participation. Token-based rewards align creator incentives, enable tipping economies, and create liquid value from entertainment skills that can be traded or spent across the ecosystem."

  "onchain_requirements": {
    "shared_state_needed": true,
    "state_description": "Leaderboard rankings, match results, earnings balances, prize pool allocations, and reputation scores must be verifiable and tamper-proof. Each battle outcome affects rankings and prize distributions that require consensus.",
    "why_onchain": "Traditional databases allow operators to manipulate rankings, fake match results, or withhold prizes. Onchain state ensures transparent prize pool management, immutable match records, and trustless payouts. Players can verify their earnings and ranking position independently.",
    "centralization_risks": "Centralized control would enable rigged leaderboards, delayed/withheld payouts, and arbitrary bans. Users investing skill and time deserve verifiable, trustless reward distribution. Platform manipulation would destroy competitive integrity."
  },
  "token_justification": {
    "token_needed": true,
    "functional_purpose": "ROAST token serves as: (1) Entry currency for ranked battles, (2) Prize pool denomination, (3) Tipping medium for audience-to-creator value transfer, (4) Purchase currency for premium arenas/themes/cosmetics, (5) Staking requirement for leaderboard eligibility. Token creates closed-loop economy capturing entertainment value.",
    "why_not_fiat": "Fiat payments have 2-4% processor fees destroying micro-transaction viability for tips/entries. 24-48hr settlement delays prevent instant prize payouts. Geographic restrictions exclude global audience. Token enables sub-penny transactions, instant settlement, and frictionless global participation.",
    "user_incentive": "Players earn tokens through skill demonstration that have real market value. Winners receive immediate, verifiable rewards. Audience can tip micro-amounts to favorite roasters. Premium cosmetics/arenas drive token utility and demand. Early participants benefit from ecosystem growth."

    "recommendation": "PROCEED - RoastPush strongly benefits from Web3 integration. Onchain prize pools and leaderboards provide trustless competitive infrastructure. Token-based rewards create aligned incentives and enable global participation. Clip virality and social sharing drive organic growth. Build as Next.js web app with Solana wallet integration and ROAST token for settlement."
