I want to build a flying game called 'Aero Map' where the player pilots a tiny paper biplane over a physical topographical relief map sitting on a museum table. The aesthetic should be a photorealistic 'diorama' style, featuring matte paper textures, stepped elevation layers, and distinct ink contour lines.
